# Sales App Demo
The project focuses on a sales storage/retrieval business use case.<br>
Since there was a strong typed language requirement by the client,choices <br>
for Golang and Typescript were made.

## How it Works 

### Preview Table
The application consists of a preview table that shows paginated orders.<br>
Users can view and sort all orders using the controls here.

### Report Upload
Sample files (csv) are included in this repo under the testData folder

#### The top five profitable item types.
#### The Total Profit.
